> Creativity is key in everything you do as a Developer, from writing code that's readable to pitching a great product to a client. Last week I had an argument with my friend over a poster design üòÇüòÇ. She wanted the poster to be pink with green lines and a purple font üëê. Oh and a background picture of a her.

This was really a challenging task, I tried showing her some great designs I could make for her, but she wanted me to use the details she emailed to me. My level of creativity was really challenged but this is definitely not new to me. Almost every month I deal with clients who just want something extra and it's always my job to deliver the best I can. Here are 5 ways that help me stay Creative as a Developer

## 1 - Challenging Myself

As someone who spends more time on the internet I've really come accross some awesome web Apps and sites that I really envy. During my free time I usually try to recreate them and really challenge myself to see if I can make the perfect clone withought looking at the source code. This helps me up my creativity levels and it gives me a hype of achievement.

## 2 - Attending Dev Meet-ups

The last Dev Meet-up i attended physically was the Google Dev-Fest held in Harare Zimbabwe. This was an awesome event, i actually made some great friends. I met Deone and Shingie who suprised me with their passion for the Tech world, both of them run some well established start-ups. Deone works with [Code Preneurs](https://codepreneurs.co.zw/) and Shingie owns [Corporate Chic CEO](https://corporatechicceo.co.zw/).

Dev meet-ups really help with engaging with fellow Comrades of Tech, you get to discuss Bugs and projects. This really boosts your skills as you get to hear someones view on a project or a solution. Dev meet ups also have pitching sessions where Developers pitch their ideas and discuss the best way to tackle certain industry Problems.

## 3 - Solving Simple Problems

My mom and I always argue on what to cook everyday üòÇüòÇso I made a simple recipe app for choosing random recipes we have in our inventory. The app helps us make the recipe that comes out when we choose what we have in the refrigerator. This app took me less than a week to complete, at first i just made a simple array of our regular meals and used math.rand( ) function to pick a random meal.

Later i discoverd an API that can generate recipes, all you have to do is post the food type you want from it and a recipe is retrived. This was an awesome silly little app made for a silly little problem. The App was first built on Vanilla Js but later shifted it to React for the fun of it.
