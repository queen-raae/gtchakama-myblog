Growing up I've always been a curious fellow. I still remember
when my Dad first beat me up after breaking down our old TV because
I just wanted to see how it worked 🤦🏽‍♂️. Fast forward some years and now he calls me every time
to fix his phone and update his apps 😂😂😂.

I have always loved to know the behind-the-scenes of every product I use, this is what drove me to
become a Software Engineer. As a Developer, I always look for ways to boost my skills to help me code faster
and be the best Developer I can be. I’ve always thought of myself to be a decent programmer, but, I’ve never had
anything to measure it against. To measure my skills I've been taking challenges and solving them.

# Here are the ways that have helped me improve my skills

## 1. Coding challenges 😅

These are cool, they don't just help by pushing you to code faster but they help improve the way you
come up with solutions. Challenges help you research the best technologies to use to come up with a solution. This is
one of the reasons I started learning React JS.

## 2. Breaking down Projects 🧩

This is by far one of the best ways that improved my skills. Whenever I find a project I like, I quickly run to find its
Github Repo and just play around with the code and see their coding practices and how everything is working out. For most of the
projects I break down I always grasp a thing or two that I will try and implement in my next project.

## 3. Follow coders you admire on social media 👱🏽‍♂️👨🏽‍🏫

If you happen to know who was responsible for a site or an app you love, find them and follow them on social media.
It’s another opportunity for you to ask questions, only this time you’ll get the answers straight from the horse’s mouth.
Plus, you can build a solid network of coding professionals on which you can rely when you need help.

# Bonus Tip: Give a talk, do a webinar or write a blog

When you learn something new, don’t keep it to yourself. Teaching others is yet another step to improving your programming
skills. Why? It helps you consolidate that knowledge and proves that you truly understand it.

So, host a webinar, stand up and speak at a meetup, or crack your knuckles and write a blog post. It’s a great way to network,
builds your confidence, and demonstrates your abilities to clients and employers.

## Final Thoughts 💬

Practice makes perfect. You just need to make sure you’re giving yourself enough time each day to
improve your programming.
