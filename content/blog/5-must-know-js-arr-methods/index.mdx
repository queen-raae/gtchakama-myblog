Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

# Here are the array methods we are going to look at

| Method  | Description                                                                             | Use           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Map     | Creates a new array with the result of calling a function for each array element        | arr.map()     |
| Filter  | Returns a new array with all elements that pass the test defined by the given function. | arr.filter()  |
| Pop     | Removes the last element of an array, and returns that element                          | arr.pop()     |
| Find    | Returns the value of the first element in an array that pass a test                     | arr.find()    |
| Entries | Returns a key/value pair Array Iteration Object                                         | arr.entries() |

## Map ( )

> This is one of my Favorite array methods. The map( ) method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. This method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. It Returns a new array with elements as the return values from the callback function for each element.

```js
arr.map(callback(currentValue), thisArg)
```

### map( ) Parameteres

The map( ) method takes in:- callback - The function called for every array element. Its return values are added to the new array. It takes in: 1. currentValue - The current element being passed from the array.

- thisArg (optional) - Value to use as this when executing callback. By default, it is undefined.

#### Notes

- map( ) does not change the original array. map( ) executes
- callback once for each array element in order. map( ) does not
- execute callback for array elements without values.

### Example 1: Mapping array elements

Lets make a small Array to explain and demonstrate the method

```js
let arr = [3, 4, 5, 6]
let modifiedArr = arr.map(function (element) {
  return element * 3
})
console.log(modifiedArr)
// [9, 12, 15, 18]
```

## 2 - Array filter( )

- Returns a new array with only the elements that passed the test

```js
var newArray = array.filter(function (item) {
  return condition
})
```

### filter( ) Parameteres

The filter( ) method takes in:- callback - The test function to execute on each array element; returns true if element passes the test, else false. It takes in: 1. element - The current element being passed from the array.

- thisArg (optional) - The value to use as this when executing callback. By default, it is undefined.

#### Notes

- filter ( ) does not change the original array.
- filter( ) does not execute callback for array elements without values.

### Example 1: filtering array elements

Lets make a small Array to explain and demonstrate the method

```js
var numbers = [1, 3, 6, 8, 11]
var lucky = numbers.filter(function (number) {
  return number > 7
}) // [ 8, 11 ]
```

---

## 3 - Array Pop ( )

This method changes the length of the array. The syntax of the pop( ) method is:

```js
arr.pop()
```

### pop( ) Parameteres

- The pop( ) method does not have any parameters.

### Return value from pop( )

- Removes the last element from array and returns that value.
- Returns undefined if the array is empty.

#### Notes

- This method changes the original array and its length.
- To remove the first element of an array, use the JavaScript Array shift() method.

### Example 1: Popping array elements

Lets make a small Array to explain and demonstrate the method

```js
const plants = ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"]

console.log(plants.pop())

// expected output: "tomato" console.log(plants);

// expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale"]
```

## 4 - Array find ( )

The JavaScript Array find ( ) method returns the value of the first array element that satisfies the provided test function. The syntax of the find ( ) method is:

```js
arr.find(callback(element, index, arr), thisArg)
```

### Find ( ) Parameteres

- callback - Function to execute on each element of the array. It takes in:

1.  element - The current element of array.

- thisArg (optional) - Object to use as this inside callback.

### Return value from find( )

- Returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the given function.
- Returns undefined if none of the elements satisfy the function.

#### Notes

- This method changes the original array and its length.only use find when you want a single element returned, and that it returns undefined if nothing is found! Otherwise, use the filter method when you need multiple elements returned.

### Example 1: finding array elements

Lets make a small Array to explain and demonstrate the method

```js
const trees = ["birch", "maple", "oak", "poplar"]
const result = trees.find(tree => tree.startsWith("m"))
// "maple"
```

## 5 - Array entries( )

In JavaScript, entries( ) is an Array method that is used to return a new Array iterator object that allows you to iterate through the key/value pairs in the array. Because the entries() method is a method of the Array object, it must be invoked through a particular instance of the Array class. The syntax of the entries ( ) method is:

```js
arr.entries()
```

### Entries( ) Parameteres

- The entries( ) method does not have any parameters.

### Return value from entries( )

- Returns a new Array iterator object.

#### Notes

- The entries( ) method does not change the original array.

### Example 1: Entries ( )

Lets make a small Array to explain and demonstrate the method

```js
const languages = ["JavaScript", "Java", "C", "C++", "Python", "Lua"]
let iterator = languages.entries()
for (let entry of iterator) {
  console.log(entry)
}
// OutPut :
;[0, "JavaScript"][(1, "Java")][(2, "C")][(3, "C++")][(4, "Python")][(5, "Lua")]
```
