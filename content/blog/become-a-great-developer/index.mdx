> Being a software engineer is one of the most demanding careers. The IT industry is very lucrative so the pressure that comes with it can really be difficult to handle. In this article, I will jump into the best practices and ways you can become a better Developer.

I am a software developer that loves to code. I am also a person that likes to spend time with family and friends, go out for a run, take in a good movie and enjoy the great outdoors. Unfortunately, my work responsibilities make it difficult to do all of these things because:

1.  I have deadlines to meet
2.  I need to deliver my best
3.  I have multiple projects that require constant attention

Below are some great tips that can help you become The Developer and help you structure out your work to best meet your schedule:

## 1 - Start writing code every day .

As you read this article grab your pc and start coding something. I used to think this was probably something I was told so that I keep myself busy but this stuff works. Coding every day increases your ability to tackle problems easily. Starting my Software Engineering journey, I used to struggle with Responsive web design.

It usually took me a week to get a single page to be responsive, but look at me now (I don’t mean to brag) I can make a website responsive within a day with no one assisting me at all. It’s all because I was coding and practicing almost every day. Consistency is Key, I always tell most people I meet this.

## 2 - Never be scared of mistakes

The first website I built was so disgusting 😅😂😂 but that never discouraged me at all. I still remember my mentor Charlie , laughing at me and saying “Georgie is this what you made all week?”. I had hyped the website so much since it was my first site. He laughed as he showed me his first website and I actually realized something.

No one starts perfect at all, Charlie told me the reason he laughed was that I was confident with my errors and he encouraged me not to be discouraged by errors because that’s what makes coding fun. Mistakes build us for greater things.

## 3 - "The code works” isn’t where you stop, it’s where you start

Yes, your first step is always to write quality software that fulfills the problem given. Average programmers quit at that point and move on to the next thing. But to stop once it’s “done” is like taking a snapshot and expecting it to be the million-dollar master ART. Great programmers know that the first iteration is just the first iteration.

It works (congratulations!) but you aren’t done. Now, make it better. Part of that process is defining what “better” means. Is it valuable to make it faster? Easier to document? More reusable? More reliable? The answer varies with each application, but the process doesn’t.

## 4 - Study code.

Reading someone’s code is by far the best way you can learn coding fast. Grab a pen and paper or take a screenshot of the code and start journaling what you see and explain why the code is there and how it is working. Starting my JavaScript journey, I downloaded people’s projects and I would go through my JS books and pdfs trying to find every concept used in that project.

Never copy code and just assume that it is working like this, study it and understand why the Developer used it. You can also ask yourself these questions:

1.  How would I have written that block of code? What would you do differently, now that you’ve seen another solution?

---

2.  What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to the code I wrote in the past? (“I’d never have thought to use recursive descent there…”).

---

3.  How would I improve this code? And if it’s an open-source project where you are confident you have a better solution, do it!

---

## 5 - Learn techniques, not tools

Programming languages, tools, and methodologies come and go. That’s why it pays to get as much experience as you can with as many languages and frameworks as possible. Focus on the programming fundamentals, because the basics never change; pay more attention to architecture than to programming. If you feel certain that there’s only one right way to do something, it’s probably time for a reality check.

# Final Thoughts

I hope this article was useful and encouraged you to become a great software developer. Don't be afraid of failure! The more ways we do something, the more likely we are going to understand it more. You only fail when you give up on learning something. So get out there and start learning!
