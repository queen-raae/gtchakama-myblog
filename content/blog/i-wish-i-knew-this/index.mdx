> Ever wished you could go back and give advice to your younger self? I bet most of you have. I know I am not the only person out there whose journey into software engineering was delayed because I just didnâ€™t know where to start.

The first steps of any career can be intimidating, coding is no exception. When starting out, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and advice out there. Knowing what the first steps should be are key, as is knowing a few other ground rules. From one experienced programmer to all the rookies out there, here are 3 things I wish I knew before I started programming.

## 1 - One programming language.

When starting you believe that you need to be the best JavaScript or C# developer. Itâ€™s just not true. Programming languages are a tool in the toolbelt and depending on the scenario you need to choose either the hammer or the screwdriver.

Throughout your career, youâ€™ll come across many tools. Some of them will always stay in your toolbelt, and some of them might be replaced.

## 2 - Itâ€™s all about problem-solving

Many people consider coding to be just something technical. But actually, it is based on a soft skill foundation which is problem-solving. Coding isnâ€™t a kind of magic, itâ€™s just thousands of lines of perfect code that executes functions and operates flawlessly (most of the time) to create a solution.

The very basis of coding is that you have a problem or something you need to achieve and you write code to get there. Gradually, you will learn how to solve problems with code and to communicate literally anything you want.

## 3 -You will never know everything

Programmers are often perfectionists and this can present itself with a desire to know everything. **Spoiler Alert :** you are never, ever, ever going to know everything there is to know about software development.

This is because, quite simply, there is too much to know. Itâ€™s also because the world of coding is always changing and developing. New languages and updates to existing ones are continually released. New libraries and frameworks are developed all the time, and new â€˜best practicesâ€™ replace the old. For this reason, you can never really know everything. The best you can do is keep up to date with your niche and what interests you.

## Bonus : _Thereâ€™s a right way to ask for help_

Everybody needs to ask for help at some point. And when you do, make sure that you do these 4 things:

1.  Deeply communicate details that you see.
2.  Explain exactly what you think should be happening.
3.  Explain exactly what is actually happening.
4.  Explain why you think it should be working differently.

## Take Away

Software Engineering is a very lucrative career, do not rush the process. Always make sure you grasp the concepts and never rush to finish a book chapter. Be patientðŸŽˆ.
